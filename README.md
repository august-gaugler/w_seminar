# w_seminar

This repository was created specifically for storing my Wissenschaftspropädeutisches Seminar work titled "Die Brachistochrone. Eine Einführung in Variationsrechnung für die Oberstufe" which I've written over the course of the academic years 2022/23 and 2023/24 with the guidance of Prof. Dr. Marc Nieper-Wißkirchen at the University Augsburg as well as P. Augustin Renner at the Gymnasium bei St. Stephan in Augsburg. 

As of 2/6/2024, a raw tex file as well as a .pdf file should be available.
I might add an English translation in the future in case anybody is interested.
