# w_seminar

This repository was created specifically for storing my Wissenschaftspropädeutisches Seminar work titled "Die Brachistochrone. Eine Einführung in Variationsrechnung" which I've written over the course of the academic years 2022/23 and 2023/24 with the guidance of Prof. Dr. Marc Nieper-Wißkirchen at the University Augsburg as well as P. Augustin Renner at the Gymnasium bei St. Stephan in Augsburg. 

As of 2/6/2024, a.pdf file as well as a preliminary version of slides should be available.
I might add an English translation in the future.
